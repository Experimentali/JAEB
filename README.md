## Contributing

Please view the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting any contributions.

See bot/plugin for info about bot plugins, web/plugin for web plugins and feeds/plugin for feeds if you wanna make a new fully fledged plugin.

Expect web, bot and feed instances to be run separately.

For basic utility/fun commands, you can just jam them in stdcommands. Use the existing commands there as an example of how to add one.
